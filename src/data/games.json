One comparison that we analyzed was the difference between characters Symmetra and Junkrat. Both fire projectiles which cause high damage on impact, but because of the difference in projectile speed (low for Symmetra and high for Junkrat) and gravity (none for Symmetra and high for Junkrat), the two heroes have very different play styles.",

Being able to swipe through and actually choose someone to talk to was a big part of the concept; we liked the idea that players would be willingly (and unknowingly) choosing someone to date who later (mild spoilers!) becomes aggressive and problematic. You play as an unnamed woman in college who is trying a Tinder-like dating app for the first time. The app is currently in development and the targeted release date is 2018.",
