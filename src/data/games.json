For example, in Overwatch, we looked at what features firearms have that changes the way users interact with them. One comparison that we analyzed was the difference between characters Symmetra and Junkrat. Both fire projectiles which cause high damage on impact, but because of the difference in projectile speed (low for Symmetra and high for Junkrat) and gravity (none for Symmetra and high for Junkrat), the two heroes have very different play styles.",
